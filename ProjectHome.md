# SpriteCutter #

SpriteCutter is a very simple program which cut a spritesheet into individual sprites. Those sprites get saved into serveral files with name format: <br>
<b>< name ><code>_</code>< # >.bmp</b>

In the future the saved sprites should not be a BMP file instead it should be saved as PNG.<br>
